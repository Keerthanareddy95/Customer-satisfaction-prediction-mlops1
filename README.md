# Customer-satisfaction-prediction-mlops1
Predicting how a customer will feel about a product before they even ordered it!

[![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/zenml)](https://pypi.org/project/zenml/)

**Problem statement**: For a given customer's historical data, we are tasked to predict the review score for the next order or purchase. We will be using the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). This dataset has information on 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. The objective here is to predict the customer satisfaction score for a given order based on features like order status, price, payment, etc. In order to achieve this in a real-world scenario, we will be using [ZenML](https://zenml.io/) to build a production-ready pipeline to predict the customer satisfaction score for the next order or purchase, by integrating with tools like [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) for deployment, tracking and more.

## :snake: Requirements

Python environment of your choice!

Starting with ZenML 0.20.0, ZenML comes bundled with a React-based dashboard. This dashboard allows you
to observe your stacks, stack components and pipeline DAGs in a dashboard interface. To access this, you need to [launch the ZenML Server and Dashboard locally](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide#explore-the-dashboard), but first we must install the optional dependencies for the ZenML server:

```bash
pip install "zenml["server"]"
zenml up
```
## :thumbsup: The Solution

We are building an end-to-end pipeline for continuously predicting and deploying the machine learning model.
This pipeline can be deployed to the cloud, scale up according to our needs, and ensure that we track the parameters and data that flow through every pipeline that runs. It includes raw data input, features, results, the machine learning model and model parameters, and prediction outputs. ZenML helps us to build such a pipeline in a simple, yet powerful, way.

In this Project, we give special consideration to the [MLflow integration](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples) of ZenML. In particular, we utilize MLflow tracking to track our metrics and parameters, and MLflow deployment to deploy our model. We also use [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to showcase how this model will be used in a real-world setting.
